        <p>One of my recent adventures was to the dynamic metropolis of Seoul in South Korea — a bustling city that not only holds a strong presence in Asia but also in the rest of the world. To date, this influence is largely due to Seoul’s cutting-edge technology, a strong economy, and vibrant culture (I’m sure that a majority of you have encountered K-pop, K-dramas, Korean cosmetics, and Korean food among many others at least once in your life!) </p>

        <p>International visitors typically arrive at the main airport called Incheon International Airport (ICN). To get here, I recommend browsing through Skyscanner to find the best flight deals from your point of origin. If you’re from the Philippines like me, Skyscanner also scans through budget airlines such as Air Asia and Cebu Pacific in order to find which of the 2 has the cheapest rate on the dates you choose.</p>
