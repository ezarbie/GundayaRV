        <h1> The Brief History of Japan</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Ancient Japan</h2>
        <p>
            <em><b>Ancient Japan</b></em> has made unique contributions to world culture which include the <em><b>Shinto religion</b></em> and its <b><em>architecture,</em></b> distinctive art objects such as <b><em>haniwa</em></b> figurines, the oldest <b><em>pottery</em></b> vessels in the world, the largest wooden buildings anywhere at their time of construction, and many literary classics including the world's first novel. Although Japan was significantly influenced by <b><em>China</em></b> and <b><em>Korea</em></b>, the islands were never subject to foreign political control and so were free to select those ideas which appealed to them, adapt them how they wished, and to continue with their indigenous cultural practices to create a unique approach to government, religion, and the arts.
        </p>
        <h2>Classical Japan</h2>
        <p>
            <Em><b>Classical Japan</b></Em> is a period when the Yamato clan rose to power and became Japan's first dynasty. It includes the Asuka, Nara, and Heian Periods.<br>
<b>500s</b> - Japanese culture is influenced by China. Chinese writing and characters are introduced.<br>
<b>538</b> -The religion of Buddhism comes to Japan.<br>
<b>593</b> - Prince Shotoku comes into power. He promotes Buddhism and brings peace to Japan.<br>
<b>752</b> - The Great Buddha statue at Nara is completed.<br>
<b>781</b> - Emperor Kammu reigns over Japan.<br>
<b>794</b> - The capital city is moved from Nara to Kyoto.
        </p>
        <h2> Feudal Japan</h2>
        <p>The feudal era of Japan consisted of three main periods,<br>the<b><em> Kamakura period,</em></b><br> Muromachi period,<br> and Azuchi-Momoyama period,<br> each named for the shoguns who controlled Japan.<br> During these periods, the Emperor technically controlled the country, but in reality, the shogun had more political power.</p>
        <h2>Early Modern Japan</h2>
        <P>Early modern Japan, or the period between 1600 and 1868, witnessed the birth of many of Japan’s most enduring cultural and political attributes, as well as the expansion of its basic geographic boundaries. For our purposes, the characterization of this period as ‘early modern’ is important because it bridges the historical chasm that usually separates the ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ realms of Japan’s historical development. Once the three unifiers had completed the military and political labours of uniting the realm, Japan developed in a manner that propelled it into the modern age.</P>
    <h2>Modern Japan</h2>
    <p>As you might know, Japan has a long history which can date back to 20,000 years ago. The entire history generally can be divided into 18 different periods such as Sengoku Period and Edo period depending on the domestic situation and political structures. In this article, we will cover Japan’s modern history which starts in the late 19th, when Japan was in the last years of the Edo period which eventually came to an end in 1868. Here is a brief modern history of Japan from the late Edo period to the present day.      </p>
